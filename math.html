            &emsp;&nbsp;After many years of taking advanced math classes, I feel experienced enough to discuss what I’ve learned and some hardships I've encountered. When I first entered more advanced math classes, I first started with just being in the ‘Honors’ equivalent classes in elementary then transitioned to middle school with higher knowledge than some of my peers. When I entered middle school, I entered honors level math classes and in the 7th grade I entered Algebra I. I then moved and I continued to take higher level math classes. I’m currently in a statistics class and for my sophomore year I took Honors Math 3 which is essentially pre-calculus.<br><br>
	        &emsp;&nbsp;After many years of taking high level math classes I can confidently say that I experienced many blockades in my understanding of certain concepts. Towards the beginning I experienced entering a pre-algebra class when I moved schools even though I was already in an Algebra class, so most of the concepts were just being repeated meaning I was essentially held back from being able to reach my full potential in math. Another hardship that I had was understanding certain concepts like understanding logarithmic functions and understanding why they work, graphing certain functions like quadratic equations and trigonometric functions, and other concepts like theta and radians. If you have any questions please feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>.
