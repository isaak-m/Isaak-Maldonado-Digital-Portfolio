        <p>
            &emsp;&nbsp;After writing many essays and answering many questions for prompts for other classes including English, one of the pieces that I feel would be suitable for display would be the Literary Responses for questions that my teacher assigned to us. The questions were based on “A Sound of Thunder” by Ray Bradbury. During writing my responses to the text I experienced many challenges that I had to overcome and I also had to critically analyze the questions many times to come up with a response.<br><br>
            &emsp;&nbsp;There were six total questions in the assignment but they were grouped in three groups of two, and we were tasked to choose one question from each group of two, so in total there were three questions that we had to answer. The questions that I ended up choosing were more complex than the others, and I chose them because I felt that it would be a challenge for me to find information on the topic and come up with a response.<br><br>
            &emsp;&nbsp;There were many challenges that I went through like not only coming up with a  response but also locating evidence that would be good to back up my points. With coming up with responses, it was difficult since I had to enter an unbiased mindset and examine evidence that I collected to not only reference but site. For the evidence challenge, it was difficult since there wasn't as much text to go through as it wasn't a large work like a full book so I had to be more investigative when locating evidence.<br><br>
            &emsp;&nbsp;While going through the challenges I had to think of CART's Habits of Mind's “Persist” and “Investigate” properties. Those two properties guided me to not only finish my work but also find good evidence within the text that I could use in the responses.
