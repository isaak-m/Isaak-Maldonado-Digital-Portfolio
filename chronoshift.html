            &emsp;&nbsp;For the Chronoshift Expeditions website, one of the main things that I learned more about and gained more knowledge on was programming CSS. The Chronoshift Expeditions website had information about different time periods that someone can enter for a traveling fee. The site was created based on Ray Bradbury's “A Sound of Thunder” where someone can buy a ticket to time travel to a certain time period.<br><br>
            &emsp;&nbsp;When creating a website one of the most important parts to making the site look good is the CSS portion. CSS is not one of the hardest parts when it comes to creating websites but it is one of the most important parts when it comes to websites. CSS is something that takes a lot of time to get comfortable with and be able to come up with a layout at a reasonable time. CSS took a lot of time for me to understand how to use since it was a completely different writing method than what I've ever learned and so it took a lot of time for me to get comfortable with. In the beginning of writing in CSS, exercises and simple tasks were tasks that took so long to finish. I believe that those exercises contributed to my way of writing in CSS because it definitely helped me now that I think back to it.<br><br>
            &emsp;&nbsp;The instructions of the Chronoshift Expeditions website were to create a website that had multiple pages that were all styled with CSS. With my prototype of the site, my expectations were very ambitious but I knew I wanted my website to stick out amongst the group. The hardest part and function to create in CSS was the on hover cards that would display text when the user hovers their mouse cursor over the image. After many attempts and failures to create the function and much time trying to figure out how to create it, I eventually was able to get the functionality of it to work.<br><br>
            &emsp;&nbsp;Whenever I struggled when writing in CSS, I was able to use CART's Habits of Mind “Persistence” because whenever something wouldn't work I knew that I had to persevere and keep on moving forward with the project. When creating the Chronoshift Expeditions site, I learned the importance of collaborating with my peers to either help me fix a problem or even help them with their own problems in their code.
