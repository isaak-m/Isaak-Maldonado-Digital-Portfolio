        <p>
            &emsp;&nbsp;The first ever site I created in the Web Application Development lab was an Adobe Spark page. The task was to create a site that demonstrated some of the activities and hobbies that I personally like to do. The bulk of the content wasn't extremely difficult as it was just text, but some of the text was hard to create since it was hard to convey some of the things I like to do in writing.<br><br>
            &emsp;&nbsp;The writing process for the site was relatively fun, but the main achievement was understanding how to use and maneuver throughout the website's functions and properties. Some of the functions in the site's user interface were difficult to learn, since it was my first time using it, and it was also slightly confusing to understand every action that a user can make. The site was accessible to the public, but we never really published it to be spread around.<br><br>
            &emsp;&nbsp;Some of the successes and challenges I faced were the overall look of the site and understanding how to fully use Adobe Spark respectively. The reason why the Adobe Spark interface was confusing to understand and learn was because I was more accustomed to the interface on applications like Google Docs or Google Slides. Even though the application was difficult to use for the first time I used CART's Habits of Mind's Perseverance attitude towards an issue. With that I was able to push myself harder throughout not only the project but also through all other projects we were tasked on completing.
