            &emsp;&nbsp;Above displays a run down of many of my works along with some of my qualifications that would be essential to applying to many jobs and internships. Above for my education, I listed two schools, though it will have another added school, Clovis Community College, and it also displays many skills that I have not only used in the class but also learned like CAD, coding, and writing professional emails.<br><br>
	        &emsp;&nbsp;The next listed article in the resume is ‘Languages’ where I said that I am able to speak two languages, English and Spanish. For my work experience I wrote that I have worked for a company called Central Valley Staffing where I worked as an IT and I am experienced in the field of robotics, where I was trained to handle machines for multiple years. For my extracurricular activities I wrote that I am experienced in the aforementioned activity, robotics, and for computer software skills I was trained in Figma, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Spark, Google Docs, Slides, and Classroom, and Visual Studio, but I am also trained to use GitHub to store and keep track of changes to my websites code.<br><br>
	        &emsp;&nbsp;Finally is my course work where I specified that I was trained in Web Application Development, Computer Science, Lego Robotics, and Computer Aided Design where I used the Solidworks program. Then are my skills and hobbies where I specify that I am collaborative with peers, experienced in the engineering and web development fields, and have spare time to cycle and play games to rest my brain and keep myself in check.
