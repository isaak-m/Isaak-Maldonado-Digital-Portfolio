        <p>
            &emsp;&nbsp;My partner, Daniel Hill, and I were tasked with writing and coding an interactive story that we called “Paranova”. The story is a sci-fi story that takes place way in the future where the player is meant to maneuver through the story by making choices that would lead them through different paths and scenarios, ultimately giving them a different ending.<br><br>
            &emsp;&nbsp;The premise of the assignment was to create a story where a user gets three different start paths, as choices, and from that the user can branch out and receive different endings, similar to how other interactive games work, like Minecraft Story Mode. When writing a story of this magnitude, we had to let our creativity guide us to the end, in total we had around 14 thousand words for the entirety of the story including every branch and option.<br><br>
            &emsp;&nbsp;With writing a story of that magnitude we came across many challenges that we had to overcome. One of those challenges was entering the writing process and trusting it to guide us through engineering a good, well written, and enjoyable story. We overcame the challenge by just letting our creativity run wild and trusting it to make the story cool and fun. Another challenge was coding the actual site to make the game playable. The reason why it was a challenge was because it was difficult to get things to work properly and get things to do what we wanted them to do like making the buttons create the story based on which button the user chose.<br><br>
            &emsp;&nbsp;With those challenges that in mind, I looked towards CART's Habits of Mind's “Persist” and “Investigate” since I had to look persist when ever I felt a “writers block” or when something was broken in the code and so I had to look through the code and find out what was going wrong and either fix it or come up with a new method. Those two properties not only helped me with completing the story but also helped me with other assignments as well.
