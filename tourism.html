            &emsp;&nbsp;The second large project in my Web Applications Development class was a tourism website where as a group we were tasked to create a website showcasing three countries of our choice. For most of the project I had to locate and choose which information would not only look best on the site but also flow the best on the site. With that in mind one of the skills that I developed was the skill of researching.<br>
            &emsp;&nbsp;When creating any type of website one of the most important phases is the research phase. The reason why it is so important is because without it the whole website would fail to do it’s purpose. One can compare a website to an essay as each portion of the site is meant to complement the other and each portion of text is meant to support the other whether that be through evidence or even explanations on how a concept works.<br>
            &emsp;&nbsp;The instructions of the Tourism Website was to create a website that displayed three countries and what someone can do there, what they can expect, what are some major exports, and what are some of the cultural activities prevalent in the areas someone might plan to visit. The next part was to find images that would not only suit the website nicely but convey and complement what we were writing for the content of the pages. Then next was to add CSS which was not only hard but I think the whole page was around two thousand lines. But that’s beside the point as a website can look very nice but if the content is lacking then people won’t be inclined to visit the website, so we had to not only do an immense amount of research to not only get our text correct but also have the site feel insightful to keep the user engaged and inclined to come back again.<br>
            &emsp;&nbsp;When creating the website I came across many blockades when locating research to not only add to the site but also reference for some of the text. With all these blockades in researching for my website I referred to CART’s Habits of Mind “Perseverance” and “Collaboration” to not only help me locate some information but also help me create the site.
