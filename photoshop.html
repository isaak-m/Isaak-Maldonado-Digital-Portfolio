            &emsp;&nbsp;Editing in Adobe Photoshop is something that I can confidently say can be difficult for some users. For me editing in the application was difficult, at first, because it was a completely different interface that I never used before. Along with that I found it hard to play with so that I could learn it since it was just something new to me so I didn't know where to start.<br><br>
            &emsp;&nbsp;There were many assignments that we were tasked with completing so that we could have experience with the program. The main reason why my instructor had us use the program was because in the world of Web Development, being able to edit photos to look good in a site would be highly beneficial for not only an employer but also to someone who has experience with it.<br><br>
            &emsp;&nbsp;There were many challenges that came with using the application. One of the challenges that I faced was at times the computer would crash because of either something I did or because the application was giving errors and sometimes it would crash. Another challenge that I experienced was the fact that it was my first time using the program so I was unfamiliar with it, because I was unfamiliar with it I didn't know where to start or where certain features were or what they even did. Eventually after playing around with the program a lot I eventually began to understand how to use it.<br><br>
            &emsp;&nbsp;After facing many of those challenges, I used CART's Habits of Mind's “Persist” habit. I used this habit wisely since it not only was a good thing to think about and have, but also a good way to think. That one habit is a good way to describe my state of mind when first using the program.
